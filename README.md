# UwuTP
TP-Party like addon that shows Enemy HP%, Enmity, and Distance, and party member HP%, MP%, and TP in easily adjusted individual text objects.

Also displays WS/Spell usage for both party members and enemies.  There's an issue where songs will occasionally encroach on other text due to length, but that's a fairly minimal issue so I'll fix it in a future update. 

Default settings are for 1920x1200 resolution, players on smaller resolutions will want to adjust x&y positions.

Color code defaults:

Enemy >66% = Cyan

Enemy >33% = Orange

Enemy <33% = Red

Player TP > 1000 = Purple

Player MP < 20% = Orange

Player HP < 33% = Red

Spells = Green

Player WS's = Pink

Mob WS's = Blue
